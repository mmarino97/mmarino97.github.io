        <p>This portfolio includes only my experience with Web Design. It is intended as a supplement to my <a href="www.maggieannmarino.com">full portfolio</a>. Enjoy looking around!</p>
        <p>I'm currently a senior at the University of Notre Dame double majoring in Marketing and Visual Communication Design. Outside of the classroom, I've been on the Athletics Marketing event staff since the fall of my sophomore year. I was the student lead for Men's Lacrosse for the 2018 season, Men's Basketball for the 2018â€“2019 season, Men's and Women's Tennis for the 2019 season, and Baseball for the 2019 season.</p>
        <p>Additionally, during my time at Notre Dame, I have had two other on-campus jobs. Being a campus tour guide for three semesters allowed me to perfect my skill of walking backwards and learn that Touchdown Jesus is officially "The Word of Life" mural. Tutoring Accounting for Academic Services for Student Athletes and then being an academic mentor encouraged me to continuously reframe material for each individual.</p>
        <p>Ever since I was a child my world has revolved around sports and that has remained true during my time at Notre Dame (not hard considering there's always a game to attend). In high school, I decided I wanted to work in sports marketing to build communities and create lasting memories at ballparks, arenas, and stadiums. Today, that goal stands strong. My dream job is to contribute to an unforgettable fan experience and build community around a sports team, league, or brand.</p>

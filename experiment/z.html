          <p>Regulator was originally designed by Rian Hughes in 1995 and then updated in 2006. In 2018, Hughes released Regulator Nova which was a revised and extended version of Regulator. The typeface is similar to early sans serifs with an M and R more closely related to British forms (<a href="https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/device/regulator-nova/">Regulator</a>).</p>
          <p>Hughes has worked in both the British and American comic industries designing logos (Batman and Robin, Batgirl, the X-Men, Captain America, and more), title sequences, posters, book covers, and more (<a href="https://www.devicefonts.co.uk/cgi-bin/device3.cgi?action=home">Device Fonts</a>).</p>

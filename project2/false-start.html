      <h4>Rulebook Definition</h4>
      <p>Each of the following is a false start by the offense if it occurs prior to the snap after the ball is ready for play and all players are in scrimmage formation.</p>
      <ul class="primary">
        <li>Any movement by one or more players that simulates the start of a play.</li>
        <li>The snapper moving to another position.</li>
        <li>A restricted lineman moving his hand(s) or making any quick movement. Exception: It is not a false start if an offensive lineman immediately reacts when threatened by a defensive player in the neutral zone.</li>
        <li>An offensive player making any quick, jerkey movement before the snap, including but not limited to:</li>
          <ul class="secondary">
            <li>A lineman moving his foot, shoulder, arm, body, or head in a quick, jerky motion in any direction.</li>
            <li>The snapper shifting or moving the ball, moving his thumb or fingers, flexing is elbows, jerking his head, or dipping his shoulders or buttocks.</li>
            <li>The quarterback making any quick, jerky movement that simulates the beginning of a play.</li>
            <li>A back simulating receiving the ball by making any quick, jerky movement that simulates the beginning of play.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>The offensive team never coming to a one-second sop prior to the snap after the ball is ready for play. This is an illegal shift that converts to a false start.</li>
      </ul>

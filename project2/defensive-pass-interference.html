      <h4>Rulebook Definition</h4>
      <p>During a down in which a legal forward pass crosses the neutral zone, illegal contact by Team A (offense) and Team B (defense) players is prohibited from the time the ball is snapped until it is touched by any player or an official</p>
      <ul class="primary">
        <li>Defensive pass interference is contact beyond the neutral zone by a Team B player whose intent to impede an eligible opponent is obvious and could prevent the opponent the opportunity of receiving a catchable forward pass. When in question, a legal forward pass is catchable. Defensive pass interference occurs only after a legal forward pass is thrown.</li>
        <li>It is not defensive pass interference:</li>
          <ul class="secondary">
            <li>When, after the snap, opposing players immediately charge and establish contact with opponents at a point that is within one yard beyond the neutral zone.</li>
            <li>When two or more eligible players are making a simultaneous and bona fide attempt to reach, catch, or bat the pass. Eligible players of either team have equal rights to the ball.</li>
            <li>When a Team B player legally contacts an opponent before the pass is thrown</li>
            <li>When there is contact by a Team B player that otherwise would be pass interference during a down in which a Team A potential kicker, from a scrimmage kick formation, simulates a scrimmage kick by throwing the ball high and deep.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
      <h4>Penalty Assessed</h4>
      <p><em>If foul occurs fewer than 15 yards beyond the previous spot:</em> Team A's ball at the spot of the foul and automatic first down.</p>
      <p><em>If foul occurs 15 yards or more beyond the previous spot:</em> Team A's ball 15 yards from the previous spot and automatic first down.</p>
      <p><em>Exception:</em> No foul outside the two-yard line can place the ball inside the two-yard line, as a result any penalty that would place the ball between the endzone and two-yard line is placed at the two-yard line.</p>

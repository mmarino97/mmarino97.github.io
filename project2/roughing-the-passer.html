      <h4>Rulebook Definition</h4>
      <p>No defensive player shall charge into a passer or throw him to the ground when it is obvious the ball has been thrown. Exception: A defensive player who is blocked by an offensive player(s) with a force so that he has no opportunity to avoid contact with the passer. However, this does not relieve the defensive player of responsibility for personal fouls.</p>
      <p>When an offensive player player is in a passing posture with one or both feet on the ground, no defensive player rushing unabated shall hit him forcibly at the knee area or below. The defensive player also may not initiate a roll or lunge and forcibly hit this opponent in the knee area or below. It is not Roughing the Passer when:</p>
      <ul class="primary">
        <li>The offensive player is a runner not in a passing posture, either inside or outside the tackle box.</li>
        <li>The defender grabs or wraps this opponent in an attempt to make a conventional tackle without making forcible contact with the head or shoulder.</li>
        <li>The defender is not rushing unabated or is blocked or fouled into this opponent.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Penalty Assessed</h4>
      <p>Penalties for roughing the passer are added to the end of the last run when it ends beyond the neutral zone and there is no change of team possession during the down</p>
      <p><em>Fouls that occur on first down:</em> 15 yards</p>
      <p><em>Fouls that occur on any other down:</em> 15 yards and automatic first down</p>

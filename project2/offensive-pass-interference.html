      <h4>Rulebook Definition</h4>
      <p>During a down in which a legal forward pass crosses the neutral zone, illegal contact by Team A (offense) and Team B (defense) players is prohibited from the time the ball is snapped until it is touched by any player or an official.</p>
      <p>Offensive pass interference is contact by a Team A player beyond the neutral zone that interferes with a Team B player during a legal forward pass play in which the forward pass crosses the neutral zone. It is the responsibility of the offensive player to avoid the opponents. It is not offensive pass interference:</p>
      <ul class="primary">
        <li>When, after the snap, a Team A ineligible player immediately charges and contacts an opponent at a point not more than one yard beyond the neutral zone and maintains the contact for more than three yards beyond the neutral zone.</li>
        <li>When two or more eligible players are making a simultaneous and bona fide attempt to reach, catch, or bat the pass. Eligible players of either team have equal rights to the ball.</li>
        <li>When the pass is in flight and two or more eligible players are in the area where they might receive or intercept the pass and an offensive player in that area impedes an opponent, and the pass is not catchable.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Penalty Assessed</h4>
